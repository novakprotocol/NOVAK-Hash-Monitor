PBAS — PROOF-BEFORE-ACTION SYSTEMS
A New Scientific Category Introduced by the NOVAK Protocol

Just as Bitcoin defined an entirely new category (“cryptocurrency”), and blockchain defined a new category (“decentralized consensus”), NOVAK defines a new cryptographic class of systems:

🟦 PBAS — Proof-Before-Action Systems

A PBAS is any system whose execution is conditioned on a validated, cryptographic, identity-bound proof produced before the action occurs, rather than logs, certification, or audit after the fact.

PBAS represents the first new computational safety category in over 15 years.

PBAS is not blockchain, not AI, not cybersecurity, not cryptography-as-usual —
it is a new governance primitive.

1. Purpose of PBAS

To formally define the new category introduced by the NOVAK Protocol:

Provide a scientific definition

Establish minimum characteristics

Differentiate PBAS from all other computing paradigms

Enable regulation, procurement, and academic classification

Allow other researchers to build PBAS-compliant systems

Bitcoin created “cryptocurrencies.”
Blockchain created “distributed ledgers.”
NOVAK creates PBAS.

2. Category Definition (Authoritative)

A Proof-Before-Action System (PBAS) is a computational or socio-technical system in which:

No state transition, output, or action may occur until its governing rule, input data, expected output, identity, and timestamp have been cryptographically proven valid, bound together, and checked against deterministic safety constraints.

PBAS requires:

pre-execution verification

deterministic rules

identity-bound proofs

global audit lineage

protection against human, machine, and physical adversaries

PBAS is the enforcement mechanism for a mathematical rule-of-law in digital systems.

3. Required Category Characteristics

PBAS systems MUST satisfy all 10 requirements:

#	Requirement	Description
1	Pre-Execution Proof	Proof must occur before execution.
2	Deterministic Rule Set	No nondeterminism in rule enforcement.
3	Identity-Bound Outputs	Results tied to a responsible entity.
4	Bound Input-Rule-Output	Via HVET or equivalent binding.
5	Irreversible Lineage	Execution receipts form RGAC or equivalent.
6	Human-Adversary Resistance	Must include PS-X-class protections.
7	Physical Adversary Resistance	Must include PL-X-class protections.
8	Global Verifiability	Proof must be objectively checkable.
9	Non-Overrideability	No actor may bypass proof requirements.
10	Universal Auditability	Any actor can verify without permission.

If all 10 conditions are met → system qualifies as PBAS.

If any condition fails → system is not PBAS.

4. Distinction From All Existing Fields

PBAS does not fall into:

cybersecurity

blockchain

AI alignment

trust frameworks

logging/forensics

deterministic computing

rules engines

compliance systems

IDS/IPS

data integrity verification

PBAS is a new category because:

It is not about after-the-fact detection

It is about before-the-fact prevention

It enforces execution determinism and verifiability

It integrates human, regulatory, physical, and cryptographic domains

Its primary operation is governance, not computation

5. PBAS vs Blockchain
PBAS	Blockchain
Local	Distributed
Pre-execution	Post-execution
Proof required before acting	Log appended after acting
No consensus required	Consensus required
Instant	Latency dependent
Regulatory enforceability	Regulatory ambiguity
Protects automated decisions	Records automated decisions

PBAS is to blockchain what preventive medicine is to autopsy.

6. PBAS vs Logging / SIEM / Audit

PBAS is not monitoring.
PBAS prevents harm instead of documenting it.

PBAS	Logging/SIEM
Blocks bad action	Records bad action
Zero trust in all actors	Trusts logs to be truthful
Pre-execution	Post-execution
Deterministic	Forensic

PBAS replaces entire categories of forensic systems.

7. PBAS vs Zero-Trust

PBAS does not trust:

actors

rules

inputs

hardware

software

timestamps

Zero-trust = “verify identity at edges.”
PBAS = “verify the entire truth before action.”

PBAS includes Zero-Trust principles but is not Zero-Trust.

8. PBAS vs AI Safety

PBAS is stronger:

AI safety → “align behavior eventually”

PBAS → “block unsafe behavior instantly”

AI safety relies on detection, heuristics, and model shaping.
PBAS requires proof of correctness before execution.

PBAS eliminates:

hallucination-driven harm

model deviation

output non-determinism

manipulation vulnerabilities

PBAS is the only model capable of closing the AI safety loop.

9. PBAS vs Robotics Safety

Robotics safety frameworks (ANSI/RIA, ISO 10218):

warn

detect

slow down

stop on impact

PBAS:

prevents the unsafe command from ever being issued

blocks unverified paths

ensures deterministic motion planning

enforces rule compliance at machine speed

Robotic automation without PBAS is fundamentally unsafe.

10. PBAS Component Requirements

A PBAS system must include:

10.1 Execution Binding

HVET or equivalent cryptographic binding.

10.2 Pre-Execution Receipt

EIR or equivalent.

10.3 Recursive Audit Chain

RGAC or equivalent.

10.4 Deterministic Safety Layer

Safety Gate (SP-3 compliant).

10.5 Adversary Protections

PL-X
PS-X
AI Adversary Model
Robotic Adversary Model
Regulatory Adversary Model

10.6 Public Verifiability

Anyone can check the proof.

11. PBAS Compliance Tiers
Tier	Description
PBAS-1	Partial compliance (no PL-X or PS-X)
PBAS-2	Full pre-execution proof
PBAS-3	Full PL-X + partial PS-X
PBAS-4	Full PS-X + PL-X
PBAS-5	Full PBAS compliance (NOVAK-level)

NOVAK is PBAS-5.

12. PBAS Applications (Global)

U.S. Federal Agencies

Healthcare

Financial Systems

Insurance Rating

Critical Infrastructure

Robotics & Manufacturing

Aviation & Aerospace

AI Content Governance

Claims Processing

Public Sector Integrity

Military Execution Systems

Legal Adjudication

Election Integrity

PBAS is universal.

13. PBAS Scientific Significance

PBAS introduces:

a new computational integrity primitive

a new scientific field

a new execution model

a new safety regime

a new adversary taxonomy

a new class of proofs

a new regulatory mechanism

PBAS enables:

provably safe automation

deterministic AI governance

state-protected integrity

global execution standards

PBAS is to execution integrity what public-key cryptography was to authentication.

14. PBAS Market Significance

PBAS unlocks:

new government modernization markets

enterprise integrity frameworks

AI governance platforms

robotics safety infrastructure

financial correctness verification

certification and audit markets

Like blockchain, PBAS will create its own industry.
