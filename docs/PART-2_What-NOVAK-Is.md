# NOVAK PROTOCOL — PART 2  
## WHAT NOVAK IS (Formal Definitions + Simple Definitions)

---

# 1. Formal Definition

**NOVAK is a deterministic, identity-bound, cryptographically attested execution-governance system requiring proof of correctness, intent, identity, integrity, and global consistency before any action is allowed to execute.**

NOVAK ensures:

- **pure deterministic rules**  
- **non-malleable input/output domains**  
- **identity-bound execution (EIR)**  
- **pre-execution prediction of output (HO)**  
- **immutable global audit lineage (RGAC)**  
- **physical-layer correctness (PL-X)**  
- **psycho-social fraud mitigation (PS-X)**  
- **public verifiability**  

---

# 2. Simple Definition

> **NOVAK forces a system to prove it is correct before it does anything.**

If proof fails → the action cannot occur.

---

# 3. NOVAK Is Not

NOVAK is **not**:

- a blockchain  
- a database  
- encryption  
- monitoring  
- logging  
- a consensus engine  

> These detect problems **after** something goes wrong.  
> NOVAK prevents the action from happening in the first place.

---

# 4. What NOVAK Replaces

NOVAK eliminates:

- ambiguous interpretation  
- nondeterministic code behavior  
- tamperable logs  
- mutable records  
- stochastic AI decisions  
- robotic drift  
- inconsistent regulatory outcomes  
- impersonation attacks

# 5. NOVAK Terminology (Mapping)

| Legacy Term | NOVAK Term | Purpose |
|------------|------------|---------|
| HARMONEE | **Safety Gate** | Deterministic pre-execution barrier |
| NIPS | **Execution Identity Receipt (EIR)** | Identity + rule + data + output proof |
| REVELATION | **RGAC** | Infinite-depth audit chain |
| — | **HVET** | Canonical pre-execution cryptographic proof |

---

# 6. NOVAK as a Rule-of-Law Engine

Every decision becomes:

- deterministic  
- identity-bound  
- irreversible  
- publicly verifiable  
- globally ordered  

NOVAK turns all automated systems into **provable rule-engines**, not guess-driven black boxes.
