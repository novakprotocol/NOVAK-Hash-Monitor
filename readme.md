# NOVAK Protocol — Proof-Before-Action Automation Integrity

NOVAK is a cryptographic execution-governance framework that requires
mathematical proof of legality **before** an automated system is allowed
to act. It ensures that every decision made by AI, government systems,
financial platforms, medical automation, robotics, and enterprise
software is **provable, traceable, tamper-evident, and accountable**.

NOVAK does not replace systems, databases, encryption, or blockchain.
Instead, it acts as a lightweight, universal safety layer — forcing
automation to justify actions **before execution**, not after the fact.

## ✅ Core Components

- **HVET — Hash-Verified Execution Token**  
  Cryptographic fingerprint of rule, input, output & timestamp.

- **Execution Identity Receipt (formerly NIPS)**  
  Signed proof artifact created before execution.

- **NOVAK Safety Gate (formerly HARMONEE)**  
  Execution is blocked unless proof validates TRUE.

- **Recursive Global Audit Chain (formerly REVELATION)**  
  Ordered chain of EIRs forming a tamper-evident timeline.

- **Formal Proof of Legality (ℕ)**  
  Binary determination: allowed ✅ / denied ❌.

## ✅ Why NOVAK Exists

Today, automated systems approve loans, deny medical benefits, modify
health records, authorize payments, move robotic equipment, and make
life-altering decisions — often without transparency, justification, or
cryptographic accountability.

NOVAK solves that by requiring:

**Prove → Then Act**

Instead of:

**Act → Then Audit**
